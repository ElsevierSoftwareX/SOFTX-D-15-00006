*** Software requirements ***
Windows 7 or later OS with DirectX 11 or newer support. If your computer is purchased on or after 2010, it probably can run this software. Gnuplot for windows(http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/files/gnuplot/) must be installed to visualize running results. Download the latest version (gp466-win32-setup.exe or newer) for best results.

*** How to Run this software ***
Drag and drop <inputFileName>.txt (e.g. cube.txt) to grace.exe and the simulation will begin automatically.

*** What to do while the software is running ***
The program window will show calculation progress (e.g. 10%, 99%). This may take minutes or hours depending on your calculation size.

*** What to do after the program finishes ***
Double click <inputFileName>.plt (e.g. cube.plt) to view visualization of simulated magnetic dynamics. The change of average magnetizations (Mx, My, Mz) is saved in <inputFileName>.mvst.txt. Detailed snapshots of the magnetization configuration are saved in <inputFilename>.data.txt. These files may be huge, but you can use professional text editors (Notepad++ etc.) to open them.
